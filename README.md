# IoT with Machine Learning

## Resources

There are 3 files to work with

- `NodeMCU_DHT_Collect.ino` used to collect the Data from the sensor and publish to a server

- `mqtt_listen.py` used to listen to incoming data from the __NodeMCU__ and save it to a csv file.
Further processing of __csv__ file is required

- `Temp_Humid.ows` is an orange application file
